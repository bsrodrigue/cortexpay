# BuildShare - Coding Practices & Guidelines

This document serves as the "Source of Truth" for coding standards and best practices used in BuildShare development.

## 1. Project Architecture

### 1.1 Modular Structure

Features are organized by domain in the `modules/` directory (e.g., `auth/`, `jobs/`, `cart/`). Each module should follow this consistent structure:

- `api.ts`: Pure functions for network requests using `APIService`.
- `hooks.ts`: React hooks orchestrating data fetching (using `useCall`) and local state.
- `types.ts`: Zod schemas for validation and their inferred TypeScript types.
- `store/`: Zustand stores for cross-component state (`index.ts`).
- `screens/`: Top-level screen components (using Expo Router).
- `components/`: UI components private to the module.

### 1.2 Service Abstractions (`libs/`)

Core functionality is abstracted in `libs/` to ensure consistency and easier maintenance (e.g., `api/`, `log/`, `notification/`, `storage/`). **Always prefer using these abstractions over raw third-party libraries.**

---

## 2. API & Data Fetching

### 2.1 The `useCall` Pattern

All mutations and imperative API calls should use the `useCall` hook (shared in `hooks/api/index.ts`).

- **Feature**: Automatic error vibration (haptics) on failure.
- **Feature**: Integrated logging via the `Logger` service.
- **Feature**: Standardized `onSuccess`/`onError` callbacks.

### 2.2 Zod Everywhere (The "Contract" Principle)

- **Input Validation**: Always parse API function parameters with `Schema.parse(params)`.
- **Output Validation**: Always parse API responses with `Schema.parse(response.data)` before returning. This prevents "broken" data from entering the app state if the backend schema changes.
- **Implementation Check**: **ALWAYS** check the `document.json` (OpenAPI spec) to ensure all available endpoints and their specific data structures are correctly implemented in the `api.ts` of the corresponding module.

```typescript
export async function myAction(params: MyParams): Promise<MyResponse> {
  const validatedInput = MyParamsSchema.parse(params); // Step 1: Validate request
  const response = await apiClient.post('endpoint', validatedInput);
  return MyResponseSchema.parse(response.data); // Step 2: Validate response
}
```

## 3. State Management

### 3.1 Global State (Zustand)

- Use Zustand for data that must persist across screens or modules (e.g., Auth state, Cart).
- Define stores in `modules/*/store/index.ts`.
- **Naming**: Export the hook as `use[ModuleName]Store` (e.g., `useAuthStore`).

### 3.2 Form State (React Hook Form)

- Use `react-hook-form` along with `@hookform/resolvers/zod` for all forms.
- This ensures UI validation is 100% consistent with API schemas in `types.ts`.

---

## 4. UI & Styling

### 4.1 Theme-First Development (Material Design 3)

- **NEVER** hardcode hex colors, font sizes, or spacing values.
- **Material Design 3 (MD3)**: The project strictly follows the Material 3 design system. Use MD3-compliant color palettes and components from `react-native-paper`.
- **Strict Check**: Even common colors like `#fff`, `#000`, or `#1a1a1a` must be accessed via `theme.colors`.
- Use `useThemedStyles` factory to access the design system tokens.
- Reference: `modules/shared/theme/` and `libs/assets/`.

### 4.2 Component Organization

- **Atomic Components**: Reusable, generic UI (Buttons, Inputs, Cards) live in `modules/shared/components`.
- **Feature Components**: Module-specific UI lives in `modules/[feature]/components/`.
- **Decomposition**: **Avoid large UI files (e.g., > 300 lines).** Break down complex screens into smaller, manageable sub-components. If a component can be reused across different screens or modules, move it to the appropriate `components/` directory.

---

## 5. Development Standards

### 5.1 Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `RegisterButton.tsx`).
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useLogin.ts`).
- **Files/Folders**: kebab-case for directories; camelCase for logic files.

### 5.2 Logging & Diagnostics

- Use the custom `Logger` class from `@/libs/log` for all logs.
- Scoped logging: `const logger = new Logger('ModuleName');`.
- **DO NOT** use `console.log` directly in production-ready code.

### 5.3 Error Feedback

- Use `Toaster.error()` and `Toaster.success()` from `@/libs/notification/toast` for user alerts.
- Prefer `useCall` for automatic error haptics and toast integration.

### 5.4 Testing & instrumentation

- **IDs**: Use `testID` prop on interactive elements with the pattern `feature_component_action` (e.g., `auth_login_submit`).
- **Tools**: Jest for unit/integration; Maestro for E2E.

### 5.5 General Principles

- **Avoid Hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding values (strings, numbers, business logic constants) as much as possible. Use constants, theme tokens, or configuration files instead.
- **Linting & Quality**: Ensure linting and error checking are solid and properly set up. ALWAYS run lint checks after modifying code to catch potential regressions or style violations.

---

## 6. Performance

- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`.
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed to memoized children to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Avoid unnecessary state lifting; keep state as local as possible.

---

## 7. Concurrency & Data Consistency

- **Avoid Race Conditions**: Implement mechanisms to handle out-of-order API responses (e.g., using flags, cancellation tokens, or state checks).
- **Stale Data**: Be cautious of stale data in closures, especially within `useEffect` or callbacks.
- **Batch State Updates**: Use functional state updates `setState(prev => ...)` when the new state depends on the previous one to avoid issues with batched updates.

## 8. Diamond Quality Enforcement

### Project Specific Rules

### Quality & Type Safety

1. **The "Diamond Resistant" Mandate**: Never use `any` or `unknown` in data flows. Every API response must be validated via Zod.
2. **Schema Synchronization**: Always ensure that Zod schemas (mobile) exactly match Backend Serializers (Django). Never assume field names or structures. Don't make the user angry and avoid stupid bugs. Make sure the zod schemas are in sync with the django serializers.
3. **UI Decomposition**: Make sure to make small screens when possible and break down views in manageable components. Avoid large UI files (e.g., > 300 lines). Break down complex screens into smaller, manageable sub-components.
4. **Routing Integrity**: In Expo Router, always ensure `Stack.Screen` names match the actual file paths (including `/index` for folders).
5. **No Hardcoded Text**: **STRICT FORBIDDEN**. All user-facing strings, including labels, placeholders, titles, and notifications, MUST be externalized into the i18n translation system (`@/libs/i18n`). Use the `t()` function from `react-i18next`.
6. **TanStack Query Invalidation**: After any mutation (create, update, delete), always invalidate relevant queries using `queryClient.invalidateQueries`. This ensures data consistency across the application without requiring manual refreshes.

### 8.1 Automated Import Sorting

- **Rule**: All imports must be sorted alphabetically and grouped by category (Built-ins, Externals, Internal Aliases, Relatives).
- **Automation**: Enforced by `simple-import-sort/imports`. Rule is `error` level.
- **Workflow**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-arrange imports.

### 8.2 Zero Unused Resources

- **Unused Imports**: Enforced by `unused-imports/no-unused-imports`. Must be removed immediately.
- **Unused Variables**: Use `_` prefix for intentional unused variables (e.g., `[_, setValue]`). Others are flagged as `error`.
- **Unused Styles**: Logic for detecting unused styles is currently disabled due to technical incompatibility with the `useThemedStyles` factory pattern.
- **In-line Styles**: **FORBIDDEN**. Prefer `useThemedStyles`. Enforced by `react-native/no-inline-styles`.
- **Color Literals**: **FORBIDDEN**. Use of hex codes or named colors outside of the theme system is blocked by `react-native/no-color-literals`.

### 8.5 Integrity Checks

- **CI/CD Threshold**: The lint command `npm run lint` uses `--max-warnings 0`. **Any** warning (even minor ones) is treated as a blocker.
- **Type Safety**: **ALWAYS** run `npx tsc --noEmit` after any functional changes or refactoring to ensure zero type regressions. The project must always be typesafe.

### 8.6 Anti-Deprecation Mandate

- **Rule**: Usage of any function, component, or utility marked with the `@deprecated` JSDoc tag is strictly **FORBIDDEN**.
- **Enforcement**: Regressions are blocked by the `import/no-deprecated` and `react/no-deprecated` ESLint rules.
- **Action**: When encountering a deprecated API, you MUST migrate to the recommended replacement immediately. Do not defer migration debt.

### 8.7 Post-Coding Verification (The "No Errors" Policy)

- **Mandate**: **NEVER** consider a task finished without running a full suite of local checks.
- **Verification Commands**:
  - `npm run lint`: To ensure zero style or quality violations.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`: To ensure 100% type safety.
- **Zero Tolerance**: Any errors found during these checks must be addressed immediately before submitting or moving to the next task. No exceptions.
